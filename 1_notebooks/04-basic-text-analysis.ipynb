    "at the level of words. According to industry estimates, only 21% of the available data is present in a structured form. Data is being generated as we speak, as we tweet, as we send messages on WhatsApp and in various other activities. The majority of this data exists in the textual form, which is highly unstructured in nature. \n",

    "Despite having high dimension data, the information present in it is not directly accessible unless it is processed (read and understood) manually or analyzed by an automated system. In order to produce significant and actionable insights from text data, it is important to get acquainted with the basics of Text Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Mining is the process of analysis of texts written in natural language and extract high-quality information from text. It involves looking for interesting patterns in the text or to extract data from the text to be inserted into a database. Text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities). Developers have to prepare text using lexical analysis, POS (Parts-of-speech) tagging, stemming and other Natural Language Processing techniques to gain useful information from text."
